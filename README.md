# Plagarism-Checker
## Plagiarism Checker Using difflib in Python

This is a simple Python script that compares the content of two text files and calculates the percentage of similarity (or plagiarism) between them using the SequenceMatcher class from Python's built-in difflib module.

### Features
Compares the content of two text files at a time.
Provides a similarity percentage as output.
Easy to use and modify for basic plagiarism detection tasks.

### How It Works
The script reads the content of two text files and uses SequenceMatcher to compare their content. It then calculates the similarity ratio and displays the plagiarism percentage.

### Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Basic knowledge of Python programming

### How to Use
Create or place the text files you want to compare in the same directory as the script. For example, t1.txt, t2.txt, t3.txt, and t4.txt.
Replace the filenames in the script with the names of your text files if needed.
Run the script.
